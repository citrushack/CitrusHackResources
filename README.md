### Wolfram Alpha API
[Wolfram Alpha Homepage](https://www.wolframalpha.com)
 
This URL will take you to a sign-in page and prompt you to log in using your Wolfram ID. If you don't already have a Wolfram ID, you'll be prompted to create one using an active email address. Once logged in, you will see in the Downloads section which platforms of the software you have access to, with their accompanying activation keys. Please download the desktop version to your machine, boot up the application and use the associated activation key when prompted. This will grant you full access for 30 days from your activation date.

When you access Wolfram|One in the cloud for the first time, you can create a new notebook or load a pre-made Things to Try live notebook, which is designed to guide you through neat things you can immediately compute in the Wolfram Language.

You can use Wolfram|One to create instant web apps and APIs, or to deploy to mobile. The Wolfram Language is also bundled on the Raspberry Pi, where you can connect directly to hardware, including Arduino etc.

The fastest way to get an API up and running is detailed in the extensive Documentation Center available to you alongside your notebook: simply click the section in the documentation labeled Cloud and Deployment and select Instant APIs to access a handy how-to guide to help get you started.

To view your account details-- including your available Cloud Credits and Cloud storage-- or re-download Wolfram|One, visit the following page:

## Prepping Your Terminal :computer:
The **terminal** on your computer, when the right resources are installed, is a powerful tool for running your code and building applications. Chances are, factory settings on your hacking machine aren't gonna cut it to streamline building your application/idea. 

The following is a list of tools/technologies help you turn your ordinary computer into a _certified_ **hacking** ***machine***!
### MacOS Specific
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
   * includes numerous general purpose languages and tools for many kinds of projects
   * even if you don't use the integrated environment, XCode is still very useful for getting an all-in-one starting package of languages installed
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
   * a package manager for MacOS and Linux
   * lets you install everything you might need that wasn't already included in XCode
